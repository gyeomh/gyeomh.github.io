Hello! I am Gyeom Hwangbo, a senior at **University of Seoul**. I am currently majoring in **International Relations** and **Statistics**.

My research interests lie in **Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI)**, with focus on perception, representation learning, and action planning. I seek to develop intelligent agents capable of comprehending and interacting with the physical world through multimodal inputs, such as vision and language.

My broader goal is to advance the development of **generalizable, human-centered embodied agents** that can adaptively perceive, reason, and act within complex and dynamic real-world environments.
